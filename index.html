  <marquee>The following content is a hot mess of trial and error that will hopefully lead to something that barely resembles a good working product that everyone can waste their time looking at and gain absolutely nothing from and then smile about it for no reason, assuming you smiled at all, it's just a guess... why are you still reading? You were told that this is worthless so why continue on with reading this? ... so you're just gonna look? is that it? I appreciate the attention but like... Dont just look, do something worth while, do some push ups, do something useful, I dont know... the way you're looking is making this feel uncomfortable so it would be nice to stop. Like okay I appreciate your commitment and im flattered but there comes a moment in time where things just... just stop. I mean it................ MEEEEEEEOOOOOOOOWWWWWWWWWWWWW  </marquee>
